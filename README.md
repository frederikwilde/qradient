# qradient
This package provides a platform for fast simulation of parametrized quantum circuits.
Also, fast optimization is facilitated by efficient gradient calculations, something that cannot be done on a physical quantum device.

## setup
This package was developed with Python 3.7.2. With older versions you might have to adapt some versions of the dependencies.
Simply edit the version number in the 'requirements.txt' file.

1) Clone the repository.
2) Create virtual environment in the repository you want to work in and activate it. E.g. with 'venv': 
```
python -m venv my-env
source ./my-env/bin/activate
```
3) Install the qradient package. E.g. with pip
```
pip install -e /path/to/qradient
```
